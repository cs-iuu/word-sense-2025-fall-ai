# Mongolian Dictionary
This is the top level repository for 2025 Fall AI Basics team project to build a Mongolian dictionary automatically.

**Goals:**
1. To create a partial, prototype Mongolian Dictionary containing a set of headwords with automatically generated word senses (clusters of usage) and sample context sentences extracted from a Mongolian text corpus (e.g., the Mongolian Bible or another large, available text).
2. To compare word meanings, usage patterns, and semantic relations with other languages (e.g., English) to reveal structural and linguistic insights.
